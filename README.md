## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) where computer systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, ML models generalize from training data to handle new, unseen inputs.

## What are Machine Learning Tasks?
Machine learning tasks are categories of problems that ML models aim to solve. The main tasks include:  
- **Classification**: Predicting discrete categories (e.g., spam or not spam).  
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., stock prices).  
- **Clustering**: Grouping data into similar clusters without labeled data.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers or unusual data points.  

## What is Classification?
Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to assign inputs to one of several predefined categories. For example, an image recognition model might classify an image as a "cat" or "dog." Classification models are trained on labeled data and aim to predict the correct class for new, unseen inputs.

## Differences Between CreateML and CoreML
- **CreateML**: A macOS app and framework used to create, train, and evaluate machine learning models with a simple, no-code or low-code approach. It's user-friendly, supports visual tools, and is ideal for developers new to ML.  
- **CoreML**: A framework for integrating trained ML models into iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. CoreML runs models on-device, offering fast, efficient inference with low latency and privacy protection. It consumes models trained with CreateML, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other ML tools.
